- Brand, aesthetic, and motion system
  - Define the “Kushan” brand identity (logo placeholder, color palette, typography, voice) and a modern, premium look-and-feel.
  - Establish a motion guideline for “smooth and subtle” animations across the site (page transitions, hover microinteractions, content reveals), prioritizing clarity and polish.
  - Specify where animation is required vs. optional (e.g., hero, product hover states, cart interactions, checkout progress) to ensure consistent, tasteful usage.

- Homepage and global navigation
  - Animated hero section highlighting key Kushan products/collections with a clear primary call-to-action.
  - Sections for featured collections, best-sellers, new arrivals, and brand story snippets, each with transition effects and subtle scroll-based reveals.
  - Global navigation with category browsing (e.g., Collections, Shop All, New), search, account, and cart indicator; sticky header with smooth show/hide behavior.

- Catalog and product detail experiences
  - Product listing grid with filters (category, size/color, price) and sort options (popularity, newest, price), including animated hover states and a quick-view panel/modal.
  - Product detail page featuring a high-quality media gallery (carousel, zoom, optional video), variant selection (size/color), clear pricing/availability, shipping info, and social proof (ratings/reviews).
  - “Add to Cart” and “Save to Wishlist” actions provide immediate, delightful visual feedback; display recommended/related products with smooth transitions.

- Cart, checkout, and transactional feedback
  - Persistent mini-cart (slide-out) and full cart page with editable quantities, remove/undo, promos, and cost breakdown; all cart interactions use responsive microanimations.
  - Streamlined checkout with clear steps (contact/shipping/payment), guest checkout option, progress indicator, real-time validation, and helpful error/success messages.
  - Order confirmation page with animated success state, order summary, and follow-up actions; simple order status page for basic tracking.

- Content, trust, and support
  - About the Kushan brand, materials/quality, craftsmanship/sustainability, and behind-the-scenes content to build trust.
  - Testimonials and reviews surfaces across relevant pages, with tasteful entrance/transition effects.
  - Contact page (form), FAQs, and policy pages (shipping, returns, privacy, terms) accessible via footer; newsletter signup with a subtle animation on submission.
